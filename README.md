# Library-Management-System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a web application developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlet, and MySQL. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing library operations, including book cataloging, user management, and book lending. The application establishes a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connection to interact with a MySQL database and execute various queries to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features
1. **Book Cataloging**: 
   - Add, update, and remove books from the library's collection.
   - Store details such as title, author, genre, ISBN, and publication year.

2. **User Management**: 
   - Register new users and manage user accounts.
   - Update user information, including contact details and membership status.

3. **Book Lending**: 
   - Allow users to borrow books and track their lending history.
   - Set due dates for borrowed books and manage overdue items.
     
4. **Search Functionality**: 
   - Search for books based on various criteria, such as title, author, genre, or ISBN.
   - Provide filters to narrow down search results.

5. **User Registration**: 
   - Allow users to create accounts to access library services.
   - Implement user roles (e.g., librarian, member) with different permissions.

## Technologies Used

- **JSP**: Used for creating dynamic web pages and handling user interactions.
- **Servlet**: Implemented to handle HTTP requests and process business logic.
- **MySQL**: Used as the database management system for storing and retrieving library data.
- **JDBC**: Established a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database to execute SQL queries.
